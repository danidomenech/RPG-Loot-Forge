Alternatively, it can be used as an area attack by making a DC 10 check. On a success, the ice covers a 7-foot-radius area.
        The ice is difficult terrain, and creatures that move across it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.</string>

    <string name="stunning_ammunition">Stunning Ammunition</string>
    <string name="stunning_ammunition_description">Can be used as an arrow or a bolt.\nThis ammunition is fitted with a rounded, heavy tip that deals bludgeoning damage instead of piercing damage.
    It is designed to bring enemies down without killing them. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this ammunition, it falls unconscious instead of dying.\n
    Undead and constructs are immune to this effect (but still take the damage).\nThis ammunition tends to break when used.</string>
    <string name="stunning_ammunition_description_extra">Each projectile ends in a rounded head, with a lead core wrapped in hardened leather.
        The finish is dull and heavy, with no edge at all, and the shaft bears signs of use and a faint oily patina.
        On impact, the tip crushes and stuns rather than piercing: a blow meant to drop, not to kill.\n
    It is an improved version of the ammunition used in training yards, which usually deals half damage.</string>

    <string name="alchemist_fire_description">As an action, you can throw this flask up to 30 feet, or up to 60 feet with disadvantage, shattering it on impact.\n
        If you throw it at a creature, make a ranged attack against the target, treating the alchemist\'s fire as an improvised weapon.
        On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage immediately and 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns until the fire is extinguished.\n
        If you use it as an area attack, make a DC 10 check. On a success, the fire covers a 10-foot-radius area. Affected creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw; on a failure they take 1d4 fire damage.
        Regardless of the save, affected creatures catch fire and take 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of their turns until the fire is extinguished.\n
        A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check and extinguish the flames. On a success, the damage ends.</string>

    <string name="oil_of_slipperiness_description">The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature and the equipment it wears and carries.
        Additional vials are required for each size category above Medium. Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature gains the effects of the <i>freedom of movement</i> spell for 8 hours.\n
        Alternatively, you can use an action to pour the contents of the vial onto the ground, covering a 10-foot-by-10-foot area of oil and replicating the effects of the <i>grease</i> spell for 8 hours.</string>
    <string name="oil_of_slipperiness_description_extra">This black, sticky ointment looks thick and heavy in the container, but flows quickly when poured.</string>

A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and choking. While it remains conscious, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
        The <i>lesser restoration</i> spell can also end this effect.\n
    The dust appears to be <i>dust of disappearance</i>, and an <i>identify</i> spell reveals it as such.</string>

        Its massive blade grants +2 to damage and attack rolls, as well as +1 AC thanks to its imposing size, as long as the wielder has at least 18 Strength.

        · Barbarian: While raging, once per rage, you can use your reaction to take the hit from an attack that targeted an ally within 5 feet of you.
        Then, with the same reaction, you can attack the aggressor with advantage.\n
        Alternatively, you can spend the same reaction to attack the aggressor with advantage if they targeted you.\n
        · Fighter (Champion or Eldritch Knight): +1 critical chance (stacking), and attacks made as a reaction have advantage.\n
        · Fighter (Battle Master): You have one additional superiority die, and your riposte maneuvers don\'t expend a superiority die if you miss the attack.\n
        · Paladin: You can perform a \'Divine Smite\' of any level from your spells without expending a spell slot once per short rest.\n\n
    This sword can be upgraded to \'legendary\' in whatever way the DM deems most appropriate.</string>
